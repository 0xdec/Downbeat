# Downbeat

This is a WIP webapp for marching bands. It is capable of displaying drill and music, and will soon have additional tools such as a metronome and tuner.

A live version is hosted at [jordi.codes/downbeat](http://jordi.codes/downbeat/).

To host locally, clone this repo and run `yarn`, then run `live-server` and navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser.
